#cpitt-vim

The Personal Vim configuration of Cameron Pitt. Heavily inspired by Steve
Francia's Vim config SPF13. Currently Targeting Neovim (I may go back and make
it backwards compatible).

## Plugins
For full list of plugins refer to [init.plug.vim](./init.plug.vim)

### Plugin Manager
Plugins are managed by [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

### Linting 
I chose [ALE (Asynchronous Lint Engine)](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) over
Neomake for it's ability to lint buffer content as you type.

### Airline
Because it looks freaking awesome
